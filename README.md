# Digit-Recognition-using-LR-MNIST

This is a *Deep Learning model* based on *Logistic Regression* and has an average accuracy of approximately **93**. 

First ML project so I am not expecting 99 % accuracy.

**Made without using any library functions except cross-entropy**

Reviews or Suggestions are welcome.

*The model_state_dict file contains the parameters of the model with 93 % accuracy*
